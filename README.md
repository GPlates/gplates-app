## Troubleshooting

### App being stuck at the start-up screen

**üîµ Clear the App storage data and cache, and then restart!!**

### Reloading App could be useful when a bug or mishap caused the App to enter and stuck in a messy state.

For example, if you see this blue ball

<img width="300" alt="blue ball error" src="https://github.com/GPlates/gplates-app/assets/2688316/cdf74619-cb3d-4753-aef8-25bc9fb6a62e">

Another example is the "Graph" data failed to load. See the empty graph chart screenshot.

To escape the "limbo", you can just reload the App by following the steps below.

- Step 1: open the "Settings" window

- Step 2: hit the "Reload App" button
